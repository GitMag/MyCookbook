# MyCookBook

MyCookBook is a solution for all your cookbook needs, designed as an advanced GUI project for COMP.CS.100 Ohjelmointi 1.

## Project Description

The project aims to provide an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for managing cooking recipes digitally. Users can store, manage, and organize their recipes conveniently using MyCookBook.

## Features

- Store cooking recipes digitally in a virtual cookbook.
- Add, edit, and remove recipes with ease.
- Create new cookbooks for different recipe categories.
- Load and export cookbooks easily.
- Search for recipes by name or ingredients.
- Sort recipes based on various criteria.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or greater installed.
2. Download MyCookBook (`main.py`) to a location with read and write access.
3. Run `main.py` to start using MyCookBook.

## Usage Details

- **Creating Recipes:** Click the "Add" button in the main UI to create a new recipe. Enter a name, optional description, and ingredients.
- **Managing Cookbooks:** Create new cookbooks, load existing ones, and export in different formats.
- **Recipe Viewer:** Double click a recipe or use the view button to see details.
- **Search and Sort:** Find recipes by name or ingredients, and sort them based on different criteria.

## App Workflow

MyCookBook loads the cookbook file location from `MyCookBook.config` in the same directory as `main.py`. It saves recipes using pickle protocol 4 to ensure compatibility with Python 3.4 onwards. Safety note: Only load cookbooks from trusted sources due to potential code execution risks with pickle.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6 or greater
- Tested on Windows 10 and Linux Mint

## Disclaimer

When using pickle to load cookbooks, ensure they are from trusted sources to avoid code execution risks.
